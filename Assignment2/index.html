                        It’s no secret that we’re obsessed with words here at Medium — but that’s not the end of the story. As many photographers on Medium have shown, pictures can help bring words to life or tell a story all on their own.

                        Whether you’re looking to use images as a highlight or the foundation of your story, this primer is our official guide to making sure the visuals of your story look great every time. We’ll start with the basics and move our way to more advanced features. This will be a living guide that we’ll edit and update as we launch new photo features, so don’t forget to save it to your bookmarks on Medium.

                            <p style="font-family:Alegreya Sans">
                                    At some point, probably next year, Elizabeth Holmes, the charismatic founder of Theranos, and her ex-boyfriend Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, the group’s former chief operating officer, will stand trial, charged with defrauding investors, doctors and patients.

                                    <br>
                                    Somewhere among the court reporters will be investigative journalist John Carreyrou, completing an assignment that started in February 2015 when he received a tip about Ms Holmes, a Silicon Valley prodigy promising to shake up healthcare with a revolutionary blood-testing system.

                                    <br>
                                    Last week, Mr Carreyrou won the Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award for Bad Blood, his first book, which chronicles the rise and fall of Theranos. Accepting the £30,000 prize at a dinner in London, he said he had “put so much time and energy into [the story] that I can’t really picture myself sitting at home seeing anybody else cover [the trial]”.

                            <h1 style="font-family: 'ABeeZee';">Goodbye, Object Oriented Programming</h1>
                            <p style="font-family:Alegreya Sans">
                               I’ve been programming in Object Oriented languages for decades. The first OO language I used was C++ and then Smalltalk and finally .NET and Java.

I was gung-ho to leverage the benefits of Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism. The Three Pillars of the Paradigm.

I was eager to gain the promise of Reuse and leverage the wisdom gained by those who came before me in this new and exciting landscape.

I couldn’t contain my excitement at the thought of mapping my real-world objects into their Classes and expected the whole world to fall neatly into place.
<br>
<br>
At first glance, Inheritance appears to be the biggest benefit of the Object Oriented Paradigm. All the simplistic examples of shape hierarchies that are paraded out as examples to the newly indoctrinated seem to make logical sense.

And Reuse is the word of the day. No… make that the year and perhaps evermore.

I swallowed this whole and rushed out into the world with my newfound insight.
Banana Monkey Jungle Problem
With religion in my heart and problems to solve, I started building Class Hierarchies and writing code. And all was right with the world.

I’ll never forget that day when I was ready to cash in on the promise of Reuse by inheriting from an existing class. This was the moment I had been waiting for.

                            <h1  style="font-family: 'ABeeZee';">All Pain, No Plane: My Grim Experience With Indoor Skydiving</h1>
                            <p style="font-family:Alegreya Sans">I was never particularly curious to experience the sensation of falling out of an airplane. But in the summer of 2015, out of a sense of obligation, I stood in front a vertical wind tunnel in Tukwila, Washington.

                                    At the time, I was working at Amazon as a marketing specialist, and our team had signed up for a corporate group activity at iFLY, an indoor skydiving facility. For roughly 60 seconds, iFLY simulates the sensation of free fall via a system of fans circulating air through a plexiglass tube, known as a vertical wind tunnel. For this, the company charges $45.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                                    I fly is the largest company operating in the indoor skydiving industry. It owns, franchises, or licenses 67 wind tunnels in 13 countries, with locations in Australia, Britain, France, and the United Arab Emirates. <br>I FLY even has facilities on select Royal Caribbean cruise ships. And while professionals skydivers do use them for practice, 80 percent of the company’s business comes from new participants: field trips, birthday parties, and team-building events like my own.</p>
